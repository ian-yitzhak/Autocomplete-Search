# Auto-Complete Search Project

This project demonstrates an auto-complete search functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page features a search bar in the center of a dark-themed layout, with suggestions dynamically generated from a predefined JSON dataset.

## Features

- **Dynamic Suggestions**: As the user types in the search bar, suggestions are filtered in real-time based on the input.
- **User Selection**: Clicking on a suggestion fills the search bar with the selected value.
- **JSON Dataset**: Includes names, emails, and phone numbers for demonstration purposes.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is centered and styled for a clean, modern look.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the page and suggestions dropdown.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for filtering and displaying suggestions dynamically.

## How to Run

1. Copy all the provided code into an `.html` file.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser.

## JSON Data Example

The dataset used for this project includes the following structure:

```json
[
    { "name": "Alice Johnson", "email": "alice@example.com", "phone": "123-456-7890" },
    { "name": "Bob Smith", "email": "bob@example.com", "phone": "987-654-3210" },
    { "name": "Charlie Brown", "email": "charlie@example.com", "phone": "555-555-5555" },
    { "name": "Diana Ross", "email": "diana@example.com", "phone": "444-444-4444" },
    { "name": "Evan Peters", "email": "evan@example.com", "phone": "333-333-3333" }
]
```

## Customization

- **Adding More Data**: Extend the `data` array in the JavaScript code with additional objects.
- **Styling**: Modify the CSS to fit your design preferences.
- **Logic**: Enhance the JavaScript for advanced filtering, such as case sensitivity or regex matching.
